= char_db (Work in Progress)

A modern C++20 module library for character encoding and decoding, built around native language features like `char8_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, and ranges, with comprehensive support for UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

This library is currently under development, providing warm welcome and vast room for contribution, bug fixes, and improvements. See link:TODO.adoc[TODO] for a comprehensive to-do list.

== Features

* **C++20 module** - Zero dependencies except the standard library
* **Unicode support** - Built-in character validation and code point conversion for UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32
* **Range-based views** - Iterate over subsequences that encode Unicode characters
* **Compile-time design** - Designed for constexpr and compile-time usage (implementation in progress)
* **CMake integration** - Built exclusively with C++20 modules, requiring CMake as the build system

== Usage

Your project must use exact C++23 standard and no additional compiler flag that will break CMI compatibility, because CMake devs and C++ community haven't really come up with a good enough model for module distribution.

After installation, find the package and link against it in CMake:

[source,cmake]
----
find_package(char_db REQUIRED)

# ...

target_link_libraries(
    your_awesome_target
    PRIVATE
        char_db::char_db
)
----

Then import the module in your source files:

[source,cpp]
----
import vspefs.char_db;
----

=== Example: Iterate over UTF-8 code points in a string

[source,cpp]
----
import vspefs.char_db;
import std;

int
main()
{
  using namespace std::literals::string_view_literals;

  constexpr auto seq = u8"üëç I'm a UTF-8 code unit sequence!! ‚ù§‚ù§"sv;
  constexpr auto code_points = U"üëç I'm a UTF-8 code unit sequence!! ‚ù§‚ù§"sv;

  for (auto view = seq | char_db::views::decoding<char_db::utf8>;
       auto const [index, subseq] : view | std::views::enumerate)
    {
      std::ranges::for_each (subseq, [](char8_t const code_unit)
        {
          std::print("{:#04x} ", static_cast<std::uint8_t> (code_unit));
        });
      std::print("-> {} ", static_cast<std::uint32_t> (char_db::utf8::to_code_point (subseq)));
      std::println("{}", char_db::utf8::to_code_point (subseq) == code_points[index]);
    }
}
----

== Building & Installing

This project uses CMake exclusively:

[source,sh]
----
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
----

To specify the library build type:

[source,sh]
----
# Build as a shared library
cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
cmake --build build

# Build as a static library
cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
cmake --build build
----

== Current API Overview

`char_db::utf8`, `char_db::utf16`, `char_db::utf32`::
Static interfaces for encoding/decoding and validation

`char_db::checked<Db, Policy>`::
`std::expected`-focused wrappers for encoding/decoding and validation (incomplete)

`char_db::views::decoding<Db>`::
