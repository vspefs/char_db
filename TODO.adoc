This document outlines planned features and improvements for the char_db library.

== Views and Range Adaptors

=== Compile-time Views
* **`char_db::views::comptime_decoded`** - A constexpr-compatible decoded view that can be stored and used at compile time

=== Encoding Views
* **`char_db::views::encoding`** - A view that encodes Unicode code points into the specified encoding
* **`char_db::views::encoded`** - A view that performs encoding but completes heavy computations during construction for better runtime performance
* **`char_db::views::code_points`** - A view that directly provides Unicode code points from encoded sequences
* **`char_db::views::encoding_convert`** - A view that converts between different character encodings (e.g., UTF-8 to UTF-16)

== Coroutine Support (Generators)

* **`char_db::co::decoding`** - A generator leveraging C++20 coroutines and the standard generator facility for lazy decoding
* Additional generators for encoding, validation, and transformation operations

== Execution Support (Senders/Receivers)

* **`char_db::exec::decoding`** - A sender that leverages the standard execution facility for asynchronous character processing
* Additional senders for parallel encoding/decoding operations

== General Improvements

=== Code Quality and Standards
* Improve overall code quality and ranges implementation
* Enhance error handling and exception safety
* Add unit tests and benchmarks

=== Performance Optimizations
* Compile-time string processing improvements
* Memory allocation optimizations

=== Documentation and Examples
* Comprehensive API documentation
* More usage examples and tutorials
* Performance comparison with other libraries

=== Platform Support
* Cross-platform testing and validation
* Compiler compatibility testing (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
* Endianness handling for multi-byte encodings

=== Waiting For...
* C++26 Contracts
* C++26 SIMD
